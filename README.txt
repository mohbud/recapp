Yelp Clone App
This app allows a user to enter what type of food they are looking for and the location. Then the app uses an API call and
RetroFit to a list of restaurants. This list is presented in the RecyclerView and shows name, category, address, distance,
rating, price, and an image using Picasso. A error message will pop up if both fields are not filled out.
